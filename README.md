Scandesign Media - Frontend Test
==========================

The reason of this case, is that we have something to talk from when you have the 2nd meeting.
So we can get a image of your technical level of JavaScript, CSS3 and HTML5. We will also look after
responsiveness.

You can use what ever frameworks as you want.

Its not meant that you need days to prepare, but 2-3 hours work can be necessary.
Other than that, we just want to say that there isn't any wrong or right way, to solve the task.

To the meeting will you meet our HR, CEO and another frontend developer. 


Guide to start
==========================

* First of all download or clone this repo

You'll need to have Webpack installed. If you already have Webpack installed, you can skip the following line.
To install webpack simply run the following line in your terminal:
* `npm install -g webpack`

* Run `npm install` to install dev dependencies. On mac use sudo if needed.

During development mode, run the default task so you'll have watchers.
* Run `npm run dev` to set fire on this test!


The task
==========================

In the src/data folder you have a JSON file, with some google coordinates and some data (address, Zip code, price, size, etc.)
Now you should add these coordinates into a google map.
Each coordinate should have a popup with the data about that house. (There should only be showned 1 popup at the time.)

OPTIONAL:

You can choose to add a filter and then filter, if its a house or a apartment.


IMPORTANT!
==========================

We will use this project to discussion and take it from there. As we wrote we don't expect that you use days one this.
You don't need to test your app/project in all browsers. its fine if its just works in your default browser.

We would like you to folk this project on github, and make you folk public, so we can test your project before the meeting.
