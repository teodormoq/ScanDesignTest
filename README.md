Scandesign Media - Frontend Test
==========================

The purpose of this case is for you to show your technical capabilities and that we can review and discuss this on the next interview.
The test covers your technical competencies within JavaScript, CSS3 and HTML5. Also, will look after responsiveness.

You are free to use whatever framework you want to.

You should not need to prepare for the test, but you probably have to set aside 2-3 hours to complete it.
We want to stress that there is no correct way to solve the task, but multiple solutions.


Guide to start
==========================

* First of all download or clone this repo

You'll need to have Webpack installed. If you already have Webpack installed, you can skip the following line.
To install webpack simply run the following line in your terminal:
* `npm install -g webpack`

* Run `npm install` to install dev dependencies. On mac use sudo if needed.

During development mode, run the default task so you'll have watchers.
* Run `npm run dev` to set fire on this test!


The task
==========================

In the src/data folder you have a JSON file, with some google coordinates and some data (address, Zip code, price, size, etc.)
Now, you should add these coordinates into a Google map.
Each coordinate should have a popup with the data about that house. (There should only be showned 1 popup at the time.)

OPTIONAL:

You can choose to add a filter and then filter, if it's a house or an apartment.


IMPORTANT!
==========================

We will use this case as a basis for the discussion at the interview.  
You don't need to test your app/project in all browsers. It's fine if it just works in your default browser.

We would like you to folk this project on github, so we can test your project before the meeting.
If you choose to make it private add user `teodormoq` to the project
